## 📌 Project Description

This project is a structured practice session completed as part of my **placement training preparation**.

The objective was not just to check whether a string is a palindrome, but to explore and implement multiple algorithmic approaches, data structures, object-oriented principles, and design patterns while solving the same problem.

Each version (Use Case) demonstrates a different computational concept and architectural improvement.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

- Algorithm design
- Data structure comparison
- Space and time complexity analysis
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- Design Patterns (Strategy Pattern)
- Runtime performance benchmarking

---

## 📚 Implemented Approaches

### 1️⃣ Two Pointer Technique
- In-place character comparison
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Most space-efficient approach

---

### 2️⃣ Stack-Based Approach (LIFO)
- Uses `push()` and `pop()`
- Demonstrates Last-In-First-Out behavior
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

---

### 3️⃣ Queue-Based Comparison (FIFO vs LIFO)
- Demonstrates behavioral difference between Stack and Queue
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

---

### 4️⃣ Deque-Based Approach
- Double-ended access
- Removes first and last directly
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

---

### 5️⃣ Singly Linked List Approach
- Fast and slow pointer technique
- In-place reversal of second half
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

---

### 6️⃣ Recursive Approach
- Uses call stack
- Base condition prevents infinite recursion
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n) due to call stack

---

### 7️⃣ String Preprocessing
- Ignores spaces and special characters
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Uses regular expressions

---

### 8️⃣ Encapsulation (OOPS)
- Created dedicated `PalindromeChecker` class
- Public `checkPalindrome()` method
- Internal logic hidden
- Demonstrates:
  - Encapsulation
  - Single Responsibility Principle

---

### 9️⃣ Strategy Pattern Implementation
- Defined `PalindromeStrategy` interface
- Implemented:
  - `StackStrategy`
  - `DequeStrategy`
  - `TwoPointerStrategy`
- Runtime algorithm selection
- Demonstrates:
  - Interface
  - Polymorphism
  - Strategy Pattern

---

### 🔟 Performance Benchmarking
- Uses `System.nanoTime()`
- Compares execution time of different strategies
- Demonstrates practical algorithm comparison

---
