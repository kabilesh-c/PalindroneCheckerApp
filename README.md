# Palindrome Checker – Data Structures Demonstration

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates palindrome validation using different algorithmic approaches and data structures.

Each Use Case introduces a new concept to understand algorithm efficiency and behavior.

## 📚 Use Case Evolution

### UC4 – Two Pointer Technique
- Concept: Compare first and last characters moving inward.
- Data Structure: None (in-place comparison)
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Most efficient approach so far.

---

### UC5 – Stack-Based Validation (LIFO)
- Concept: Use Stack to reverse string.
- Operations: push(), pop()
- Data Structure: Stack
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Demonstrates LIFO principle.

---

### UC6 – FIFO vs LIFO Comparison
- Concept: Compare Queue (FIFO) and Stack (LIFO).
- Operations:
  - Enqueue → add()
  - Dequeue → remove()
  - Push → push()
  - Pop → pop()
- Data Structures: Queue, Stack
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

This version visually demonstrates the behavioral difference between FIFO and LIFO structures while validating palindrome logic.
