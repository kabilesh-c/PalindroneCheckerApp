### UC13 – Performance Benchmarking

Goal:
Compare execution time of different palindrome strategies.

Strategies Compared:
- TwoPointerStrategy
- StackStrategy
- DequeStrategy

Key Concepts:
- System.nanoTime()
- Runtime measurement
- Algorithm efficiency comparison

Observation:
- TwoPointerStrategy generally performs fastest (O(1) extra space).
- Stack and Deque use additional memory (O(n)).
- Actual time differences depend on input size and JVM optimizations.

Learning Outcome:
Understanding practical performance beyond theoretical complexity.
